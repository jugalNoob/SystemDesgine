🔐 Key Takeaways

Google stores almost everything you do in its ecosystem if settings allow

Screenshots are NOT tracked unless you manually upload them

Most location is approximate, not precise GPS unless enabled

You can view, delete, or pause most of these logs

All logs are private to your account, not shared publicly
