Ah, this is a common concern! Let’s be super clear and calm 😄

🔊 Can Google or your phone listen to your conversations?
1️⃣ Normal behavior (without “Hey Google” / “Ok Google”)

Phones do NOT constantly record audio

Google does not secretly listen to your private conversations

Apps cannot access your mic unless you explicitly allow

Your casual chat with a friend is not being recorded.

2️⃣ When your phone DOES listen

Your phone only activates the microphone in certain cases:


| Case                                     | What happens                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Voice Assistant (Google Assistant, Siri) | Listens only after trigger phrase (“Hey Google”)                  |
| Voice Notes / Recording apps             | Only records when you press record                                |
| Calls                                    | Carrier and apps can transmit voice, but only for the call itself |
| Permissions granted to apps              | Some apps can access mic when allowed, but must ask permission    |


Modern phones show a mic indicator if an app is using it.

3️⃣ Can Google use conversations to target ads?

Google says: they do not use your phone conversations to target ads

Ads are based on:

Search history

Location

Web & App Activity

YouTube history

Not from your microphone listening

If you ever hear “we show ads based on your talk” — that’s coincidence or algorithmic guess, not actual listening.

4️⃣ How to be 100% safe

Disable Google Assistant voice detection:
Settings → Google → Search, Assistant & Voice → Voice Match → Turn off

Check mic permissions for apps:
Settings → Privacy → Microphone → Disable apps that don’t need it

Use apps like Signal or WhatsApp for encrypted calls/messages

Keep phone OS updated → prevents malicious apps from secretly accessing mic

✅ Key Takeaway

Your casual conversation with a friend is not being recorded by Google or your phone.
Microphone access is only activated on purpose or by allowed apps.

If you want, I can explain why it sometimes feels like ads “hear” you, and what the real mechanism is — it’s mostly algorithmic prediction, not spying.

Do you want me to explain that?
