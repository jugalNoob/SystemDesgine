Nope — Telegram cannot see if you take a screenshot in most cases. ✅

Let me explain carefully, because there are some exceptions. 🧠

1️⃣ Regular chats (cloud chats, groups, channels)

Screenshots are not tracked.

Telegram does not send a notification to the other person if you screenshot messages.

Your action is local to your device only.

2️⃣ Secret Chats (end-to-end encrypted)

Screenshots still cannot be detected by Telegram itself.

However, on iOS, apps cannot technically prevent screenshots.

Telegram used to warn about screenshots in secret chats, but on most devices today it does not send alerts.

Bottom line: Secret Chats are encrypted, but screenshot detection is mostly a myth.

3️⃣ Video Messages / Self-Destructing Media

If you send self-destructing photos/videos in Secret Chat:

Telegram does not detect screenshots, but the media disappears after viewing, so you can’t store it for long.

Some apps like Snapchat can detect screenshots, but Telegram does not officially notify.

4️⃣ Tips for Privacy in Telegram

Use Secret Chats for sensitive messages

Use self-destruct timers for photos/videos

Avoid sharing sensitive media if storing it locally is a concern

✅ TL;DR

Telegram cannot track your screenshots in normal chats or Secret Chats.

Screenshots are always local — only stored on your device.

If you want extra security: use Secret Chat + self-destructing messages.
