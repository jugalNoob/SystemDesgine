Here’s the clear answer:

🦆 Can DuckDuckGo store your logs?

Short answer: Yes, but very minimal, and not tied to you personally.

Let me break it down carefully. 🧠

1️⃣ What DDG logs

DuckDuckGo does not track you personally, but for technical purposes it may temporarily log:


| Thing            | How it’s used / stored                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **IP address**   | Temporarily used to serve search results; not stored long-term for tracking                |
| **Search query** | Processed to return results; some anonymized logs may be used to improve the search engine |
| **Server logs**  | May record timestamp, browser type, and general technical info (like any website server)   |




mportantly: these logs are not linked to your identity, email, or device permanently.

2️⃣ What DDG does NOT log

Your name, email, or account info

Search history tied to you

Browsing across other websites

Personalized ad data

Unlike Google, DDG does not build a profile on you.

3️⃣ How they protect privacy

IP anonymization: IP addresses are truncated or temporarily used

No cookies for tracking: Search doesn’t leave trackers

HTTPS encrypted: Search content is encrypted from your ISP

4️⃣ TL;DR

DuckDuckGo may temporarily store minimal logs for technical purposes, but it cannot identify you personally, and it does not create a user profile.

✅ Privacy tip for extra safety:

Use DuckDuckGo Browser or Tor

Use a VPN → hides your IP even from DDG

Avoid logging into any account when searching
