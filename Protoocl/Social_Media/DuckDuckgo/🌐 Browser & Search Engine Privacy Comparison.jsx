🔑 Key Takeaways

Google → Tracks almost everything, builds a personal profile for ads and recommendations.

DuckDuckGo → Minimal tracking, no personal profile, temporary anonymized logs.

Brave → Focused on privacy, blocks trackers/ads, good choice for normal browsing.

Tor → Maximum privacy & anonymity, hides IP and location, prevents tracking entirely.

💡 Extra Tips for Maximum Privacy

Combine DuckDuckGo + Tor → untraceable search & browsing.

Use a VPN → hides your IP from search engines and websites.

Avoid logging into accounts while wanting privacy.

Regularly clear cookies & cache, or use private/incognito mode.
