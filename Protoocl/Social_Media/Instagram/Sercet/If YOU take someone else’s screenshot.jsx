Short answer: most of the time, NO notification 👍
But there are two special cases where it does notify. Let me break it super clearly.

📸 If YOU take someone else’s screenshot
Will they get notified?
❌ NO notification when you screenshot:

Posts

Reels

Stories

Profile photos

Highlights

Normal DM chats

👉 They will NOT know.

✅ YES notification when you screenshot:

Only if it is:

DM → “View once” / “Allow replay” photo or video

DM → Vanish Mode ON

📩 Instagram sends a message like:

“⚠️ Screenshot taken”

📸 If SOMEONE takes YOUR screenshot
Will YOU get notified?
❌ You will NOT be notified if they screenshot:

Your post

Your reel

Your story

Your profile

Your highlights

✅ You WILL be notified if:

You sent a view-once / disappearing photo or video in DM

Vanish Mode was ON

🧠 Easy rule to remember

Public content = NO notifications
Private disappearing DM content = YES notifications

🔒 One more important thing

Even when there’s NO notification:

Instagram may still use screenshot behavior for algorithm signals

BUT the other person never sees your name
