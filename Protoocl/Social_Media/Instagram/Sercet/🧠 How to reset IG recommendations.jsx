 Perfect! Let’s go step by step 🧠 — this is the fastest way to reset Instagram recommendations without losing your account or followers.

Think of this as teaching IG your “new taste”.

🔄 How to Reset IG Recommendations
Step 1: Clear Search History

IG tracks what you search heavily. Clearing it removes old signals.

Go to: Settings → Security → Clear Search History

Confirm clearing all recent searches

Optional: Long-press posts on Explore → Not Interested to remove old Explore signals.

Step 2: Use “Not Interested” Everywhere

On the Explore page:

Tap … (three dots) → Not Interested

On Reels:

Tap … → Not Interested

Do this for 20–30 posts to teach IG what you don’t want.

Step 3: Limit Strong Engagement Signals

IG favors:

Rewatching Reels

Pausing on posts

Saving/Sharing

To reset:

Scroll fast through content

Avoid saving or sharing

Don’t repeatedly visit the same profiles

Goal: IG stops recommending content based on old engagement.

Step 4: Archive / Hide Old Content

Posts, saved items, and liked posts still influence recommendations

Archive posts that no longer reflect your current interest

Remove old saves

This removes “ghost signals” from your account.

Step 5: Start Fresh with Intentional Engagement

Like, save, share only content you currently enjoy

Watch stories fully for the accounts you like

Interact with new topics to retrain the algorithm

IG adapts fast to your new behavior.

Step 6: Optional — Use Browser Mode

Logging in via browser gives weaker signals, letting you explore without affecting app recommendations

Use the app for deliberate engagement only

Step 7: Be Patient

Algorithm takes 2–7 days to reflect changes

Recommendations gradually shift toward your new interests

✅ Extra Pro Tips

Don’t overuse “Not Interested” — spacing it out works better

Avoid rewatching old posts/stories you don’t want

Regularly engage only with content you truly want to see

💡 Quick analogy:
Think of IG like a smart puppy:

Old habits = old recommendations

Reward new behavior = new content shows up

Ignore old habits = algorithm forgets them
