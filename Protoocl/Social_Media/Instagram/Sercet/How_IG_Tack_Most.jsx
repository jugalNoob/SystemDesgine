Alright, this is the real core of Instagram’s brain 🧠
Not myths, not guesses — what IG actually tracks the MOST.

I’ll rank them from STRONGEST → WEAKEST signals.

🔥 What Instagram ACTUALLY tracks the MOST (in order)
🥇 1️⃣ Watch Time (KING 👑)

This is the #1 signal.

IG tracks:

How long you watch a reel/post

If you re-watch 🔁

If you pause ⏸️

If you watch till the end

👉 Even NO like, full watch = very strong interest

🥈 2️⃣ Shares (especially DMs)

Sharing = “this is worth sending”

IG tracks:

Share to DM (strongest)

Share to story

Copy link

📌 DM shares are more powerful than likes.

🥉 3️⃣ Saves

Save = future value

IG thinks:

“This content is useful, not just entertaining”

Saves beat likes every time.

4️⃣ Comments (QUALITY > quantity)

IG tracks:

Comment length

Replies & back-and-forth

Questions & opinions

“🔥🔥🔥” < “This helped me because…”

5️⃣ Profile Visits

IG tracks:

Visit count

Time spent on profile

Scroll depth

Follow after visit (huge boost)

Profile visit = curiosity signal.

6️⃣ Repeated Searches

Searching same username multiple times = high intent

Often leads to:

More of their posts

Story priority

Suggested follow

7️⃣ Screenshot Behavior

IG tracks:

Screenshot / screen record (internally)

Treated like a “silent save”

No alerts (except vanish DM).

8️⃣ Follows & Unfollows

IG tracks:

How fast you follow after viewing

How quickly you unfollow (bad signal)

Follow + engage combo (great signal)

9️⃣ Likes (Overrated 😅)

Likes are:

Easy

Fast

Low effort

Still useful, but not top priority.

🔟 Skips & “Not Interested”

IG also tracks negative signals:

Fast scroll past

Muting

Hiding

Reporting

These hurt reach more than no engagement.

🧠 Why IG tracks these

IG’s only goal:

Keep users inside the app longer

So it prioritizes time + meaningful actions.

🔐 Final truth

If you want privacy:
Scroll fast, don’t pause, don’t re-watch.

If you want growth:
Make people stop, watch, save, share.
