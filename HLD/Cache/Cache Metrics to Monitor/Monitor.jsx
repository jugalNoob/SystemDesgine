🧮 Cache Metrics to Monitor


| Metric           | Why It Matters                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Hit Ratio**    | Higher means better cache efficiency |
| **Miss Ratio**   | Indicates DB load                    |
| **Evictions**    | Tracks how often data is removed     |
| **Latency**      | Redis/Memory read-write speed        |
| **Memory Usage** | Prevent OOM (Out Of Memory) errors   |
