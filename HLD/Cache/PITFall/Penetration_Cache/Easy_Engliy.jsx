Sure! Let’s explain Cache Penetration in super simple English. 🧠

🧹 Cache Penetration – Easy Meaning


🚨 What is Cache Penetration?

Cache penetration happens when:

👉 A request asks for data that does NOT exist in DB

👉 Cache doesn’t have it

👉 So every request hits DB again and again

Example:

GET /students?id=99999999  // This ID does not exist


If 10,000 attackers hit this →
DB will be overloaded.

Definition:

Cache Penetration happens when requests ask for data that doesn’t
 exist in the database, and these requests always miss the cache, 
 hitting the database every time.

🔹 Why It Happens


Cache only stores real data from DB

If someone requests a wrong key or ID that doesn’t exist:

Cache can’t store it

DB gets hit every single time

High traffic on wrong requests can overload your DB

🔹 Real-Life Analogy

Cache = library with popular books

DB = main warehouse

Someone asks for a book that doesn’t exist

Library can’t serve it → warehouse is checked every time

Warehouse keeps getting requests for a non-existent book → unnecessary load

🔹 Key Points

Happens for invalid/malformed keys or attacks trying random IDs

Unlike cache miss, this is permanent miss because the data truly doesn’t exist

🔹 Easy One-Liner

Cache Penetration = “Requests for non-existent data that always
 hit the DB and never hit cache.”
