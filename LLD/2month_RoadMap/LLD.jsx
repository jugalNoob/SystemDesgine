🧠 Goal

By the end of 2 months, you’ll be able to:

Design clean, extensible OOP systems

Apply SOLID principles & design patterns

Write UML diagrams and class structures

Build end-to-end mini LLD projects (like Parking Lot, BookMyShow, etc.)

Crack LLD rounds confidently.

📆 2-Month Roadmap (8 Weeks)
🗓️ Week 1 – OOP & Core Principles

Goal: Build a strong OOP foundation.

✅ Topics:

OOP Concepts:

Class, Object, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction

SOLID Principles:

Single Responsibility

Open/Closed

Liskov Substitution

Interface Segregation

Dependency Inversion

Composition vs Inheritance

Interface vs Abstract Class

💻 Practice:

Model a User system (Admin, Guest, Moderator)

Design a simple Library Management system

📚 Resources:

“Head First Object-Oriented Design”

YouTube: “OOP + SOLID Explained Simply” (by CodeWithHarry or Tech Dummies)

🗓️ Week 2 – UML & Design Thinking

Goal: Learn to visualize systems.

✅ Topics:

UML Class Diagrams

Relationships:

Association, Aggregation, Composition

Sequence Diagrams

State Diagrams

💻 Practice:

Draw UML for “Parking Lot” and “Online Shopping Cart”

Try using tools like draw.io or Eraser.io

🗓️ Week 3 – Design Patterns (Creational)

Goal: Understand object creation patterns.

✅ Topics:

Singleton Pattern — Global Logger, DB connection

Factory Pattern — Shape Factory / Notification Factory

Builder Pattern — Object construction flexibility

Prototype Pattern

Abstract Factory Pattern

💻 Practice:

Implement a Logger (Singleton)

Implement NotificationFactory (SMS, Email, Push)

🗓️ Week 4 – Design Patterns (Structural)

Goal: Learn patterns that organize relationships between classes.

✅ Topics:

Adapter — Make incompatible classes work together

Decorator — Add behavior dynamically (e.g. coffee add-ons)

Composite — Tree structure like menus, files

Facade — Simplify complex APIs

Proxy — Access control, caching

💻 Practice:

Design a File System using Composite

Implement Caching Proxy for an API

🗓️ Week 5 – Design Patterns (Behavioral)

Goal: Learn how objects communicate.

✅ Topics:

Strategy — Different algorithms for same problem

Observer — Notify all subscribers (e.g., YouTube notifications)

Command — Undo/Redo system

State — Vending machine

Chain of Responsibility — Logging, validation chain

Template Method — Skeleton of algorithm

💻 Practice:

Implement NotificationService using Observer

Build ATM Machine using State Pattern

🗓️ Week 6 – End-to-End Mini LLD Projects

Goal: Combine multiple patterns & principles.

💻 Projects:

🎫 BookMyShow System

Classes: Movie, Show, Theater, Seat, Payment

Patterns: Singleton (DB), Factory (Payment)

🚗 Parking Lot System

Classes: Vehicle, Slot, Ticket, ParkingLot

Patterns: Strategy (Fee Calculation)

🗓️ Week 7 – Advanced LLD Projects

Goal: Practice complexity & scalability.

💻 Projects:

🛵 Food Delivery (Zomato/Swiggy)

Rider, Order, Restaurant, DeliverySlot

Use Observer + Strategy + Factory

💬 Chat System (WhatsApp)

User, Chat, Group, Message

Use Observer + Singleton + Mediator

🗓️ Week 8 – Mock Interviews & Documentation

Goal: Prepare for interviews.

✅ Topics:

Review all patterns + SOLID

Practice UML + code walkthroughs

Learn to explain trade-offs in design

Write README + diagrams for all projects

💻 Practice:

Do 3 full LLD mocks:

Design Elevator System

Design Splitwise

Design Cab Booking (Ola/Uber)
